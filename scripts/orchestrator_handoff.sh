## Instructions for New Orchestrator
You are taking over as the CCC orchestrator. Continue building the Claude Code Coordinator.

## Current Status
- Core concept proven: Can spawn and control Claude sessions
- Live monitoring working: scripts/watch_ccc.sh
- Directory organized and cleaned
- Ready to build full MCP server

## Your Next Tasks
1. Continue from TODO list (see below)
2. Build the complete CCC MCP server
3. Implement session orchestration
4. Create specialized templates

## Active TODOs
$(cat CLAUDE.md | grep -A 20 "## Current Status" || echo "Check CLAUDE.md for current status")

## Key Commands
- Activate environment: source scripts/activate_ccc.sh
- Watch live sessions: ./scripts/watch_ccc.sh
- Verify permissions: ./scripts/verify_permissions.sh

## IMPORTANT
You have --dangerously-skip-permissions for full autonomy.
Continue with FULL FORCE development approach - no boundaries!
