Session ID: test-session-001
Created by: CCC Orchestrator
Timestamp: {time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}
Message: This file was created by a Claude Code session under CCC control

Tasks completed by controlled session:
1. Created this proof file
2. Listed directory contents
3. Created a Python script that calculates Fibonacci numbers
4. Executed the script and captured output

This demonstrates that CCC can:
- Spawn new Claude Code sessions
- Give them specific tasks
- Monitor their execution
- Collect their outputs

=== END PROOF ===

Then create a Python script called fibonacci.py that calculates the first 10 Fibonacci numbers and run it.
