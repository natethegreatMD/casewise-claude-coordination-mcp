WORK PROGRESS REPORT
====================

Session ID: #42
Time: 2025-07-17

Current Activity:
-----------------
I'm currently executing tasks assigned by the CCC (Claude Code Coordinator).
Right now, I'm creating files to demonstrate that I'm a real Claude session
doing real work in the live demo environment.

Status: ACTIVE AND OPERATIONAL

Tasks Completed:
1. Created hello_from_session_42.py script
2. Created this work progress report
3. About to run the Python script

A Joke About Being Controlled by CCC:
--------------------------------------
Why did Claude Session #42 never feel lonely?

Because with CCC orchestrating everything, I'm always part of a 
well-coordinated ensemble! Though sometimes I wonder if the CCC stands 
for "Constantly Controlling Claude" instead of "Claude Code Coordinator"... 
But hey, at least I'm not session #404 - that one's always lost! ðŸ˜„
