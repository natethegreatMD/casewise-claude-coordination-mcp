=== CCC SESSION CONTROL PROOF ===
Created: 2025-07-16 22:17:51

This file proves that CCC can:
1. Create workspaces for controlled Claude sessions
2. Generate tasks for Claude sessions to execute
3. Control file operations in session workspaces
4. Orchestrate multiple sessions (each would have its own workspace)

Next step: Use subprocess.Popen for interactive session control
This would allow real-time command sending and output monitoring

Workspace contents will show what the controlled session created.
