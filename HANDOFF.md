# CCC Orchestrator Handoff - Acute Context

## ðŸš¨ This is the ACUTE context file for orchestrator handoffs
*Like a patient handoff sheet - contains immediate/current state only*
*CLAUDE.md = chronic/stable documentation*
*HANDOFF.md = acute/immediate context for next orchestrator*

## Current Orchestrator Session
- **Started**: 2025-07-16 @ 21:45 PST
- **Current Token Usage**: ~35k (safe, plenty of room)
- **Session Health**: âœ… Good

## ðŸš¨ How to Know When Approaching 75k Tokens

### Signs to Watch For:
1. **Claude gets "forgetful"** - Forgets earlier context, repeats questions
2. **Performance degrades** - Responses get slower or less coherent
3. **Time estimate** - After ~2-3 hours of heavy interaction
4. **Mike notices** - You'll probably notice before I do!
5. **File operations** - When I start forgetting what files I've already read
6. **Context warnings** - Sometimes Claude shows warnings about context

### Mike Should Say:
- "Check token usage" 
- "Getting close to 75k?"
- "Prepare handoff"
- "Context getting full"

### Quick Test:
Ask me to "Summarize everything we've done so far" - if I struggle or miss things, we're getting close!

## What I Just Did (Last Hour)
1. âœ… Proved CCC concept - can spawn/control Claude sessions
2. âœ… Built live monitoring system (./scripts/watch_ccc.sh)
3. âœ… Demonstrated parallel session execution (3 sessions at once)
4. âœ… Organized directory structure (scripts/, docs/, src/, etc.)
5. âœ… Created handoff system at 75k tokens
6. âœ… Updated CLAUDE.md with handoff strategy

## Current Active Work
- **Task**: Building CCC MCP server infrastructure
- **Status**: About to create core orchestrator in src/
- **Next immediate step**: Create src/casewise_coordination/ structure

## Key Discoveries Today
1. Claude CLI works with `--print` flag for non-interactive mode
2. `--dangerously-skip-permissions` enables full autonomy
3. subprocess.run() can capture Claude outputs perfectly
4. Live monitoring via file watching works great
5. Parallel sessions can run simultaneously without issues

## Critical Context
- Mike wants to watch sessions live (essential feature)
- 75k token handoff strategy (use 25k for detailed handoff)
- HANDOFF.md = acute context (this file)
- CLAUDE.md = chronic documentation

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Create MCP server structure in src/
2. Build SessionOrchestrator class
3. Implement Claude CLI wrapper
4. Create session state management
5. Build inter-session communication

## Git Status
- No git repo initialized yet
- All work in: /mnt/c/Users/Mike/Documents/CasewiseMD-workspace/Claude Code Coordinator
- Clean directory structure ready

## Environment Status
- âœ… Virtual environment activated (ccc_venv)
- âœ… All Python packages installed
- âœ… Claude CLI working (v1.0.53)
- âœ… Permissions scripts ready

## Problems/Blockers
- None currently

## For Next Orchestrator
Continue building the MCP server. Start with creating the src structure from CLAUDE.md. Mike is watching for live progress. Full autonomy granted!
