## Quick Token Test
Ask me: "What was the first file we created?" or "Summarize our progress"
If I struggle with early context, we're approaching limits.

## When to Handoff
- **75k tokens**: Start preparing detailed handoff
- **85k tokens**: Must handoff soon
- **90k tokens**: Critical - handoff immediately
